 *  @title NerwoEscrow
 *  @author: [@sherpya]
 *
 *  @notice This contract implements an escrow system with dispute resolution, allowing secure transactions
 * between a sender and a receiver. The contract holds funds on behalf of the sender until the transaction
 * is completed or a dispute arises. If a dispute occurs, an external arbitrator determines the outcome.
 *
 * The main features of the contract are:
 * 1. Create transactions: The sender initializes a transaction by providing details such as the receiver's
 *    address, the transaction amount, and any associated fees.
 * 2. Make payments: The sender can pay the receiver if the goods or services are provided as expected.
 * 3. Reimbursements: The receiver can reimburse the sender if the goods or services cannot be fully provided.
 * 4. Execute transactions: If the timeout has passed, the receiver can execute the transaction and receive
 *    the transaction amount.
 * 5. Timeouts: Both the sender and receiver can trigger a timeout if the counterparty fails to pay the arbitration fee.
 * 6. Raise disputes and handle arbitration fees: Both parties can raise disputes and pay arbitration fees. The
 *    contract ensures that both parties pay the fees before raising a dispute.
 * 7. Submit evidence: Both parties can submit evidence to support their case during a dispute.
 * 8. Arbitrator ruling: The external arbitrator can provide a ruling to resolve the dispute. The ruling is
 *    executed by the contract, which redistributes the funds accordingly.
